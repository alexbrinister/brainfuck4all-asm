# Brainfuck For All (Assembly Version)
### Summary
Cross-platform [brainfuck](https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/) compiler, written in various assembly flavors, for various platforms.

### Details
To force myself to get into x86 and multi-platform assembly, I wanted to write a Brainfuck compiler... because why not!?

### Simple Roadmap
1. Implement x86 compiler (Intel flavor)
2. Implement x86 compiler (GNU flavor)
3. Implement some toy example programs
4. Implement ARM compiler
5. Implement PPC compiler
6. Implement AVR compiler (...maybe?)
